Description:
When American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center on the
morning of September 11, 2001, WABC-TV were broadcasting Good Morning America, a show produced by
the national ABC News division. After resuming from commercial break at 0851, the channel broke away
from national programming to their own Eyewitness News Special Report. Anchor Steve Bartelstein was
later accompanied by Lori Stokes and others. At various points they returned to the national
coverage with Peter Jennings.

WABC-TV was one of many local television stations who had transmitter facilities located on the top
floor of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. One of their maintenance engineers, Donald
DiFranco, was a victim of the attacks.
